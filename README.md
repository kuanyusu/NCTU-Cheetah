# NCTU-Cheetah

In this project, a compliant leg mechanism for low-cost quadruped pet robots had
been studied and built. Inspired by the published literature from EPFL-Cheetah and
Oncilla robots, a new quadruped robot NCTU-Cheetah based on the compliant leg
mechanism mentioned above had been realized too. NCTU-Cheetah robot relies on
the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) algorithm to control its 12 servo motors,
including 4 tilt motors that allow hip adduction and abduction. The V-REP simulation
model of NCTU-Cheetah robot, CPG program, and other helper utilities were open
sourced here.
